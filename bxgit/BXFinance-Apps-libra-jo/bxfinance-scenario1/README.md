# BXFinance React App
This is just general info. See the README file one directory up.

If you want to modify the UIs and app functionality, you need to be familiar with
- React Library
- JSX
- ECMAScript 2017
- SASS
- Reactstrap
- Node and npm

Though we have containerized the React app for production, this is NOT a requirement to run it, should you decide to clone BXF and run it on your laptop or other host. Once you have the code, you can just run `npm start .env`.

The .env config file has the info you need to make sure it runs on your host and which environment variables need to be in sync with env_vars in your BXF server profile.
