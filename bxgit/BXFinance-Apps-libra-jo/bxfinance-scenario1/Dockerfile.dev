# This Dockerfile is used development images only.
# The .env config file should be updated accordingly before running "docker build...".
# The Dev environment has its own DockerFile and Compose YAML file because we want 
# a React "dev build" that allows for hot code reloading and volume mounted source for
# development with VSCode Remote.
